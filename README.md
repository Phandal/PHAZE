# PHAZE

A little program that I am trying to write to generate mazes. I am want to use the Recursive Backtracking method of generating the maze. To do this
I also need an implementation of a stack. I am trying to write one of those also! Maybe I will split the stack into a different git repo and save this one for the maze.
