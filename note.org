#+Title: Maze Notes

* Recursive Backtracking algorithm
Uses a stack and recursion to go through all squares in the grid and mark as visited.
A high level overview
1. Initalize starting point and push it to the stack. Also, update visited counter
2. Look for cells that are adjacent to the current cell that are not visited.
3. Choose one at random and push it to the top of the stack as the new current position
4. rinse and repeat until there is a cell that has no unvisted neighbors.
5. Once here, pop up the top part of the stack and look for unvisited neighbors at the last location.
6. Rinse and repeat until all cells have been visited.
